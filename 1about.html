    <p>Around 400 BC, the Celtic Insubres settled Milan and the surrounding region.[1] In 222 BC, the Romans conquered the settlement, renaming it Mediolanum.

        History tells us that Mediolanum (Milan), the Latinized form of Medhelanon, meaning "sanctuary", was founded by the Insubri Celts in 590 B.C. 
        According to Titus Livy's comments, the city was founded around 600 B.C. by Belloveso, chief of the Celtic tribe. Legend has it that Belloveso found a 
        mythological animal known as the scrofa semilanuta (in Italian: "half-woollen boar") which became the ancient emblem of the city of Milan
         (from semi-lanuta or medio-lanum). Several ancient sources (including Sidonius Apollinaris, Datius, and, more recently, Andrea Alciato) have argued 
         that the scrofa semilanuta is connected to the etymology of the ancient name of Milan, "Mediolanum", and this is still occasionally mentioned in modern 
         sources, although this interpretation has long been dismissed by scholars. Nonetheless wool production became a key industry in this area, as recorded during 
         the early Middle Ages (see below).
